# Introduction to data analysis and management in R {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the course website of "Data management and analysis in environmental sciences". 

The aim of this course is to provide a basic introduction to analysing and visualizing data with R. 
In this course, we focus on tools provided by the so-called tidyverse, a collection of R-packages that allows for 
quick, efficient and readable data analysis.
