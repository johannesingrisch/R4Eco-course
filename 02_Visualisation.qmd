# Data Exploration & Visualization

> The art of looking at data

Efficient data visualization is key in data science. Not only will it help you to understand your own data, but also is it a primary mean to communicate results to others and make complex results easiert to understand. 

Last but not least, litte is more satisfying then to come up with really cool visualisations of your research. 

In this course we will focus on visualizing data with a R-package called 'ggplot2'. It is part of the tidyverse and once you overcome the initial barrier it is very easy to handle and incredible versatile. 

Before creating the first plots, we need a first idea of the struture and content of the dataset we are interested in. For this, R provides some nice functions. 

To get started we use a dataset that is already included in R called `mpg`.
