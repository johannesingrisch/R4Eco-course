## What is 'tidy data'?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
include_graphics("./figures/Wickham_tidydata_screenshot.png")
```

http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper


## Same data can be stored in multiple ways

```{r, out.height= "50%"}
# wide representation 
table1

# long representation
table2
```




## Same data can be stored in multiple ways

```{r, out.height= "50%"}
table1

table3
```


Can also be spread over multiple tables

```{r, out.height= "50%"}
# cases
table4a

# population
table4b
```

Not all of these representations are easy to work with. 

## Rules for a tidy dataset

A tidy dataset follows __3 Rules:__

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell

![Tidydata rules (Source: R4DS)](./figures/tidydata_rules.png)

## Why ensure that your data is tidy?

1. Consistent data structure makes it easier to apply tools that work with it

2. Most R-functions work vectorised.

3. Works neatly with all types of tidyverse packages

# Exercise

check out the Exercise Part 1



## So why is not all data always tidy?

- Most data is __not__ tidy. 

- Most of the time we will need to tidy up before analysis


> The tidyverse comes for rescue. It provides a bunch of really helpful tools for efficient cleaning transformation of messy datasets. These are provided by a package called `tidyr`.

# The `Tidyr` package

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
include_graphics("./figures/tidyr.png")
```

Two major functions to transform tables 

- pivot_wider(): make long tables wide

- pivot_longer(): make wide tables long


## pivot_wider()

> make a long table wide

Make sure to have tidyr 1.0 or above. In previous versions this functionality was covered by the function `spread()`. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}

table2 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, 
              values_from = count)

```

![Function of pivot_wider() (Source: R4DS)](./figures/tidy_pivot_wider.png)


We need to specify: 

- `names_from`: which column contains the new column names?
- `values_from`: which column contains the values?

- Additional options: 
- `?pivot_wider`
- `vignette("pivot")`


## pivot_longer

> Makes a wide table long.  

This function does the reverse operation of pivot_wider(). It makes a wide table long. 

In previous versions of `tidyr`is was called `gather()`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c('1999', '2000'), 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "cases")
```

![Function of pivot_longer() (Source: R4DS)](./figures/tidy_pivot_longer.png)


We need to specify: 

- `cols`: choose columns to be transformed 
- `names_to`: column-name for the key, in quotes
- `values_to`: column-name for the values, in quotes

- Additional options: 
- `?pivot_longer`
- `vignette("pivot")`

Selection of columns in `cols` argument can be forward or backward

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# forward: define which columns to use
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c('1999', '2000'), 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "cases")

# backward: define which columns NOT to use
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-country), 
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "cases")


```

## Splitting columns: separate()

Problem: column `table3$rate` contains multiple values in one cell. 

```{r}
table3
```

We can solve this using the function `separate()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```


![Function of separate() (Source: R4DS)](./figures/tidy_separate.png.png)


> Where does it separate?

By default: Whereever it sees as non-alphanumeric character. 

We can also specify it

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# separate at "/"
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/") 

# separate at defined position
table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)

```


Look careful at column types of output. New columns are stored as 'character'. That doesn't allow us to do calculations.

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
```

Solution: 

`convert = TRUE` tries to change the column-types to better types

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE) 
```


## Unite columns: `unite()`

The inverse operation of `separate()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
include_graphics("./figures/tidy_unite.png")
```

![Function of unite() (Source: R4DS)](./figures/tidy_unite.png)


# Missing values

Missing values can be either explicit or implicit. 

- An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence. 

- An implicit missing value is the absence of a presence. 


```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2016, 2016, 2016),
  quarter    = c(   1,    2,    3,    4,    2,    3,    4),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.35,   NA, 0.92, 0.17, 2.66)
)

stocks

```


We can make implicit NA's explicit. 

```{r}

# take set of columns and finds all uniqe combinations, fill with NA in case combination is missing
stocks %>% 
  complete(year, quarter)

```

Or we can make explicit NA's implicit. 
```{r}
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=year, 
              values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = - quarter, 
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "return")
```

```{r}
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=year, 
              values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = - quarter, 
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "return", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE)

```


## Missing values: fill()

Quite often columns are incomplete. `fill()`allows to fill a column. 

Example:

```{r, include = FALSE}
treatment <- tribble(
  ~ person,           ~ treatment, ~response,
  "Derrick Whitmore", 1,           7,
  NA,                 2,           10,
  NA,                 3,           9,
  "Katherine Burke",  1,           4
)

```

```{r}
# original file
treatment

treatment %>% 
  fill(person)

```

# Summary: TidyR

A tidy dataset follows three rules: 

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
include_graphics("./figures/tidydata_rules.png")
```

The functions `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`and `separate` allow us to tidy up messy tables.
