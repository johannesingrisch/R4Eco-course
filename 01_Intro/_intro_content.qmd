## Installation 

Install R and Rstudio on your computer, if already installed, make sure they are up to date. 

Both programs are available for free: 

- R: https://cloud.r-project.org
- RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/download


## R & R Studio

![R Studio working environment](./figures/RStudio_Basic.PNG)

## Hands-on

- use R as a calculator
- use a script and send code to the console

## Getting organised: R-projects & R-scripts 

>- your whole data science project within one folder
>- this folder as working directory for R
>- Rscripts: store with meaningful names
>- use relative paths instead of absolute
>- 'R-Studio projects' help to organise this

>- __Everything in one place__
>- __Allows sharing & moving between computers__



## Hands-on: Workflow Basics

Together we 

- create a project for this course
- create an R-script
- write code in script and send to console
- comment the script using '#'


## Additional functionality: R-Packages

- add-ons
- increase functionality of R

Important in this course (and for life):

-      tidyverse
- readxl

Can be installed via 

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

and loaded via 

```{r, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

Task: install tidyverse


## Base-R and the tidyverse (I)

Base-R means the 'original' language of R. Typically, this contains a lot of `$` square brackets `[]`. Certainly important to know, but sometimes a bit hard to follow, especially when getting started with R...

Example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Base R
time.as.string = paste(CO2_ML$year,CO2_ML$month,CO2_ML$day,sep="-")
CO2_ML$dt = as.POSIXct(strptime(time.as.string,"%Y-%m-%d"), tz = "GMT") # convert time to an R time stamp
CO2_ML[CO2_ML==-999.999] = NA 

```

## Base-R and the tidyverse (II)

In this course we will also learn a lot of 'tidyverse' style, which is simpler to read and write. 
Typical are functions with useful names and the so-called pipe `%>%`. We will get to know all this in the course. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# tidyverse
CO2_ML %>% 
  mutate(time.as.string = paste(year, month, day, sep = "-"), # create timestamp
         dt = ymd(time.as.string, tz = "GMT"), # convert to time
         CO2_ML = ifelse(CO2_ML == -999.999, NA, CO2_ML))  
  
```

>- complements and supplements base-R code
>- does not replace base-R
>- increases efficiency
>- tons of useful functions
